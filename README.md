## what this is
This is my schoolwork repository.

I created it so I can work across computers over GitHub rather than through a messy cloud software.

- old work from **AP Computer Science A** (2020-21) `apcs`
- **AT Computer Science: Data Structures** (2021-22) `atds`
- **AT Computational Physics** (2021-22) `atcp`
- **AT Post-Euclidean Geometry** (2021-22) `atpeg`
- future classes
